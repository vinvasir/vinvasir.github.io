I never even hated my old job. Sure, I would push papers on a daily basis, huddled in a windowless cubicle under flickering fluorescent lights. The nonprofit budget didn't exactly leave room for perks, but my role gave me a sense of purpose. Whenever I helped a client navigate the debt collection bureaucracy, I knew I was helping them beat an almost superhuman foe. 

Plus, I would hear, who'd want to be in a field where you not only have to master algorithmic thinking but also constantly learn new languages and frameworks to stay relevant? In other fields, I could at least count on some stability, after building one skill-set. 

But as time went on, I thought back to my college days, when I needed to learn (human) languages for my major. I never wanted to dedicate my career to language teaching or even linguistics, but it was never the skill-learning process that exhausted me. Once I was out in the "real world" for a while, I found that I *missed* learning skills and problem-solving techniques, and not just facts. I wanted to combine the craftmanship and logical puzzles from my undergrad days with the world-changing sense of purpose I got from working in a nonprofit. 

By the beginning of this year, I started working on some web development projects and haven't looked back since. The field has been a perfect combination of all my interests, and I can't wait to be doing it full-time.
