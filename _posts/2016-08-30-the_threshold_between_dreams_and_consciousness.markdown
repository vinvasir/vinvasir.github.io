title:  "The threshold between dreams and consciousness"

In one of the volumes of Neil Gaiman's *Sandman* series, Steve Erickson describes a conversation he had with his father in a dream. His father had been dead for weeks, but in the dream he said their conversation was absolutely real. Whenever Erickson told people of this conversation, they all agreed that his dream-father was right. Erickson implies that this conversation occurred on the fine edge between dreams and wakefulness. To Erickson, the best fantasy authors, such as Gaiman, live on that threshold all the time, bringing those fleeting dream-images into words, speech bubbles, and pictures that the rest of us can enjoy.

At its best, programming offers the same possibilities. Code's possibilities range from the sublime, such as self-driving cars and DevArt, to the uncanny, such as automation and Uber's legal troubles. But either way, I find it undeniable that programming offers an expressive power that can and should be as creative as it is disruptive. 

To follow in that spirit, I'll maintain a list of productive, socially useful coding projects here, along with status updates when they happen.

* **A case-management tool for social services intake**: several of these tools already exist, but they tend to be proprietary and don't make much use of external APIs. I plan to make a free-and-open-source version, with access to APIs such as Courtlistener.
* **Participate in Code For America brigades**: Both the Durham and Raleigh groups have meetups and ongoing civic tech projects. This should be a good chance to learn how to work on existing code bases and practice my git branch skills.
* **Resume addressing open-source issues, especially for organizations active in the area**: For example, at past meetups I've done some work on the documentation for the Rails Paperclip gem developed by Thoughtbot. With my formal learning winding down, it's time for me to dive back into these projects full-time.

Expect this list to continue growing, and stay tuned for posts about my new projects!
